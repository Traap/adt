/**
 * Project Euler Problem #17
 * Number letter counts
 * 
 * If the numbers 1 to 5 are written in words: one, two, three, four, five then
 * there are 3+3+5+4+4=19 letters used in total.
 * 
 * If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out
 * in words, how many letters would be used?
 * 
 * Note: Do not count spaces or hyphens.  For example, 342 (three hundred and
 * forty-two) contains 23 letters.  The use of "and" when writing out numbers is
 * in compliance with British usage.
